# gatsby-minimal-portfolio-blog

Based on the GatsbyJS starter (based on [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)) for a minimal portfolio website with blog. Suitable for developers.

So I haven't done much to customize this. Coming soon, better image handling using Gatsby.js's native functionality for creating the correct image sizes to send down for each screensize.
